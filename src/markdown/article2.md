# Laravel `whereExists` Method Guide

The `whereExists` method in Laravel's Eloquent ORM allows you to add a subquery to your query. It's used to check for the existence of a related record or a specific condition in a subquery.

## Syntax

```php
$query->whereExists(\Closure $callback)
```

## Parameters

- **\Closure $callback**: A closure that defines the subquery for checking existence.

## Usage

### Basic Example

To get all users who have at least one post:

```php
$users = User::whereExists(function ($query) {
    $query->select(DB::raw(1))
          ->from('posts')
          ->whereColumn('posts.user_id', 'users.id');
})->get();
```

### Using `whereExists` with Relationships

Assuming you have a `User` model with a `posts` relationship:

```php
$users = User::whereExists(function ($query) {
    $query->select(DB::raw(1))
          ->from('posts')
          ->whereColumn('posts.user_id', 'users.id');
})->get();
```

### Combining with Other Conditions

To get users who have at least one post and are active:

```php
$users = User::where('active', true)
             ->whereExists(function ($query) {
                 $query->select(DB::raw(1))
                       ->from('posts')
                       ->whereColumn('posts.user_id', 'users.id');
             })
             ->get();
```

## Notes

- The `whereExists` method is useful for filtering records based on the existence of related records in a subquery.
- Ensure that your subquery's select statement includes `DB::raw(1)` or a similar constant value to avoid syntax errors.

## Conclusion

The `whereExists` method is a powerful tool for advanced querying in Laravel, enabling you to filter results based on the existence of related records. Use it to create complex queries with subqueries efficiently.
